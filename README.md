# EXE_Program for MS2MP
MS2MP is a novel deep learning-based framework for KEGG pathway prediction directly from untargeted tandem mass spectrometry(MS2).


# Configurations for MS2MP
We recommend that MS2MP should run in a computer with at least 16 G of memory and 256 G of disk space. We have demonstrated the program's usability on two computers with the following configurations:<br>
1):
GPU: Intel® Iris® Xe graphics
CPU: Intel® Core™ i7-12700
Running memory: 128 G
Disk space: 1 T<br>
2):
GPU: NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 4090
CPU: AMD Ryzen™ 9 9950X
Running memory: 64 G
Disk space: 2 T<br>
Users can choose a computer with similar or higher configurations.
